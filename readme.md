# Hyperk

Hyperk is a minimalist, high-performance uni-platform WiFi LED driver for ESP8266, ESP32 (S2, S3, C2, C3, C5, C6), Raspberry Pi Pico W (RP2040, RP2350). Designed as a lightweight and streamlined component that avoids unnecessary complexity, it delivers low‑latency performance and integrates smoothly with platforms such as HyperHDR, while offering essential home‑automation capabilities through a clean, modern codebase.

## Installation

The firmware can be flashed directly from your browser:
**[hyperk.hyperhdr.org](https://hyperk.hyperhdr.org)**

> [!TIP]
> Once installed, you can also perform OTA updates directly through the local **Web GUI**.
